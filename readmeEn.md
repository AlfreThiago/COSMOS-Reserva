## How it work?

### For Clients

If you need an urgent repair, Cosmos allows you to:

* **Make personalized requests**: Describe your computer equipment problem with all the necessary details. You can specify the type of service, device model, and any other relevant information so technicians can better understand your needs.

* **Direct communication**: Once a technician accepts your request, you'll have the opportunity to communicate with them directly. This allows you to resolve questions, get more details on the problem, receive progress reports, and stay updated on the status of your equipment.

* **Real-time tracking**: View the status and progress of the technician's work from your dashboard. You'll know at all times what stage the repair is in, which gives you peace of mind and confidence.

_**Cosmos**_ offers freelance technicians a platform to:

* **Find job opportunities**: Access a list of client requests near your area or specialty.

* **Manage your projects**: Easily coordinate your work, communicate with clients, and update the status of each service.

* **Build your reputation**: Demonstrate your professionalism and skill in every job, which will help you attract more clients.
